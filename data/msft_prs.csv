2018-10-11T16:36:30+00:00,2018-10-11T14:00:25+00:00,Press Releases,"INDIANAPOLIS – Oct. 11, 2018 – Today, Eric J. Holcomb, Indiana Governor; Zoë Baird, CEO and President of the Markle Foundation; Beth Cobert, CEO of Skillful (a Markle initiative); and Mary Snapp, Head of Microsoft Philanthropies, announced that Skillful will begin operations in Indiana, bringing investment, training, tools and innovative methods to augment Governor Holcomb’s Next Level workforce development plan. The launch of Skillful Indiana brings together the Markle Foundation, Microsoft Philanthropies, LinkedIn, Walmart, Lumina Foundation, Purdue University and Purdue Extension with the Governor’s Workforce Cabinet and local workforce development boards to create better pathways to good jobs for Hoosiers. Skillful Indiana will work with Indiana businesses and the state’s innovative educational community to equip Hoosiers with marketable skills that are the new currency of the digital economy.

First established in Colorado, Skillful is dedicated to enabling all Americans – particularly those without a four-year college degree – to secure good jobs in a changing economy. Skillful engages employers, educators, policymakers and workforce development organizations to create a labor market in which skills are valued, and people can more easily access the information and education they need to secure good jobs. Skillful, with its strategic partner Microsoft, selected Indiana for expansion after careful consideration as it possesses critical elements and needed infrastructure for success, including strong support from the Governor and Indiana’s workforce ecosystem.

“Adding Skillful to the Hoosier state is a game-changer when it comes to skilling up our workforce,” Gov. Holcomb said. “Here in Indiana, we’ve built a strong pro-growth business climate and have a fully-funded infrastructure plan, but we also need to ensure every Hoosier is prepared for this ever-changing economy while attracting more people to fill the jobs of tomorrow. Skillful Indiana will serve as a force multiplier—strengthening and building upon workforce efforts already underway to connect people with the skills they need for high-wage, high-demand jobs.”

“Markle is bringing Skillful’s unique model to Indiana to help create a labor market that provides equal dignity for people who have developed skills in many different ways: on the job, from neighbors, in a related job in another sector or from more formal post-secondary education,” said Zoë Baird, CEO and President, the Markle Foundation. “By helping employers show the skills they need, and everyone to see more clearly the great ways to train at every stage of a career, we will open up opportunity to thousands more Hoosiers. Employers will see the talent in their own communities and workers will be inspired to become lifelong learners who can keep pace with the evolving needs of a digital economy.”

In the next decade, Indiana will need more than 1 million skilled workers to fill open jobs and support economic growth. Working with its national and local partners, Skillful is tailoring Skillful Indiana’s programs to the unique strengths and needs of the state: employer programs for Indiana’s distinctive mix of large and small, urban and rural employers; education initiatives tailored to Indiana’s innovative higher education system; and investment in career coaches as an important support for Hoosiers navigating educational and job opportunities.

Skillful will bring to Indiana innovations developed in its first state, Colorado, as well as those shared within the Skillful State Network, a coalition of 20 governors, including Governor Holcomb, who have made innovation in workforce development a state priority. The Skillful State Network was born out of the tremendous interest Skillful received from other states based on its work in Colorado. The Skillful State Network provides a forum to share Skillful’s approach, tools and assets quickly. States like Indiana have always been laboratories for innovation and today are leading the transformation to the digital economy.

“We are incredibly impressed with the extraordinary work going on in Indiana. With Skillful Indiana, we see a tremendous opportunity to bring additional resources, national partners and road-tested programming to contribute to the exciting things happening here,” said Beth Cobert, Skillful CEO.

“Microsoft and LinkedIn partnered with Markle to develop the Skillful model in order to ensure more Americans can benefit from the digital economy. Working with our Indiana partners, Skillful Indiana will advance a new mindset of lifelong learning and increase opportunities for jobseekers to gain necessary skills and connections to employers,” said Mary Snapp, Head of Microsoft Philanthropies.

Skillful Indiana will focus on accelerating a skills-based labor market through the following:

 “In collaborating with Hoosier employers, current workers, students, parents and teachers, we’re eliminating a one-size-fits-all mentality and embracing new ways of attacking the workforce challenge—like bringing Skillful’s expertise and resources to better prepare a robust, skilled workforce,” said Danny Lopez, Governor’s Workforce Cabinet Chairman.

Skillful Indiana Founding Partners

“In a changing economy, we need a labor market with access to lifelong learning and quality training, with a focus on developing people’s competencies. We are excited to partner with Skillful to accelerate Indiana’s efforts to take promising practices nationally and put them to work for the benefit of Hoosiers.”

— Jamie Merisotis, President and CEO, Lumina Foundation

“Purdue and Skillful are partnering to advance our shared goal of connecting Hoosiers with the opportunity to flourish, when just starting out and throughout a lifetime of learning. It is a natural pairing with Purdue’s extensive network of campuses and innovative online educational options.”

— Mitch Daniels, President, Purdue University

“Walmart and Skillful have a shared interest in building effective approaches to learning and career advancement. We are excited to support their work in equipping Hoosiers with the skills needed for the changing economy.”

— Kathleen McLaughlin, Senior Vice President and Chief Sustainability Officer, Walmart Inc.; President, Walmart Foundation

2018-10-11T07:05:46+00:00,2018-10-11T07:04:28+00:00,Press Releases,"MUMBAI, India — Oct. 11, 2018 — Microsoft Corp. and Anil Kumble’s technology startup, Spektacom Technologies, with support from broadcast partner Star India, came together on Thursday to announce the introduction of the Power Bat. The Power Bat provides players, coaches, commentators, fans and viewers with a completely new and unique way to engage with the sport and help improve their game — all powered by the Microsoft Azure cloud platform using AI and Internet of Things (IoT) services.

Microsoft has been working closely with Spektacom and its founder Anil Kumble, former captain, Indian cricket team, to incubate and launch the product, as part of its ScaleUp program. Star India, the leading cricket broadcaster in India, has used the technology successfully in recent series to provide real-time statistics and insights straight off the oval.

“We’re excited to be a part of the work Spektacom and Star India are doing to enhance the cricket experience for fans, players and coaches,” said Peggy Johnson, executive vice president, Microsoft. “We’ve already seen the impact that connected devices have had in other industries, and we believe that with the advancements in our AI and cloud services, this is just the beginning of what’s possible for not only cricket, but all sports.”

Sanjay Gupta, managing director, Star India, said, “Star India has always strived to redefine and elevate experiences for sports fans. From Multi-language feeds and Select Dugout to VR and Watch n’ Play, the coverage of Vivo IPL demonstrates our commitment toward creating new benchmarks in how technology is deployed to deepen fan engagement. The Power Bat promises to be another step in the same direction, and we look forward to the partnership with Anil Kumble (Spektacom) and Microsoft in bringing it to our broadcasts.”

According to Anil Kumble, former captain, Indian cricket team, and founder, Spektacom, “Our vision is to bring sports closer to fans through interesting ways of engagement using real-time sports analytics. At the same time, it is important that the technologies used are seamless and do not disrupt the game or obstruct the players. With Microsoft, we have been able to create a secure and effective solution, and with Star India, we have a partner that can stimulate and excite fan engagement.”

The Power Bat is a unique concept whereby a lightweight, Azure Sphere-powered sticker is stuck on the shoulder of the bat — a form factor that is completely unobtrusive. In a live match, as soon as the batsman hits the ball, data on different parameters (speed on impact, twist on impact and quality of the shot — percentage proximity of the ball’s contact to the sweet spot of the willow) are captured in a new unit of measurement titled Power Speks. Microsoft’s Azure Sphere ensures that the data is securely captured and processed. Using advanced analytics and AI services on Azure, real-time insights are captured through the stump box and displayed via the broadcaster. During practice or coaching, the same data can be viewed through a mobile app.

Although the technology introduced by Spektacom today has its first use case in cricket, for Microsoft, Anil Kumble and Star India this is the first of many sports where it can be used.

Microsoft believes in leveraging its technology and its people to help sports teams and organizations solve their toughest challenges. By leveraging the company’s intelligent cloud and productivity solutions, sports organizations worldwide are connecting with fans, optimizing team and player performance, and managing their operations in new, innovative ways.

Community members identified to Microsoft’s Datacenter Community Development that access to Wi-Fi is a significant need in the region.

“Internet access is very important to this community as it helps our residents fully participate in the 21st century economy,” said Mecklenburg County Administrator Wayne Carter. “That is why we advocated for this project, and why we appreciate this contribution by Microsoft and Lake Country Satellite.”

The community Wi-Fi system recently completed its testing phase and can be accessed through any wireless device through the network ID Boydton Wi-Fi. Users can log in to the network for two-hour increments.

“As a locally owned and operated company for two generations, this project has really been a labor of love for us,” said Lake Country Satellite’s David Varner. “The work we’ve done with Microsoft allowed us to build the infrastructure that will benefit everyone that lives in, conducts business in or visits Boydton.”

Microsoft has also supported Mecklenburg Electric Cooperative’s work securing a $2.6 million grant from the Virginia Tobacco Region Revitalization Commission to fund the launch of its new broadband subsidiary, Empower, which plans to deploy 135 miles of fiber broadband across Southside Virginia. All this work is part of Microsoft’s broader commitment, through its TechSpark Virginia program to foster greater economic opportunity and job creation in the region.

“Internet access is needed for accessing social and economic opportunities — whether it is connecting a small business to new markets, improving healthcare, creating new opportunities in education or supporting innovation in agriculture — yet too many people in rural communities lack access,” said Microsoft’s TechSpark Virginia manager, Jeremy Satterfield. “This new system will help close a gap that prevents too many of our residents from fully participating in the digital economy.”

Other projects in the Boydton area sponsored by Microsoft include workforce training through the Datacenter Academy at Southside Virginia Community College and the Southern Virginia Higher Education Center; grants to local nonprofits, including Vets on a Roll and Mecklenburg County Community Services Corp.; and Microsoft helping build computer science programs at local high schools, through its Technology Education and Literacy in Schools (TEALS) program.

,2018-10-10T15:15:58+00:00,Press Releases,"Charleston, S.C. (October 10, 2018) — Blackbaud (Nasdaq: BLKB), the world’s leading cloud software company powering social good, and Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT), today announced they are jointly investing in an Integrated Cloud Initiative for Nonprofits™, which will accelerate cloud innovation in areas that address critical market needs across the mission lifecycle. As part of this initiative, the companies introduced their first jointly-developed solution set: Nonprofit Resource Management™, a purpose-built resource management suite optimized for the complex and differentiated needs of nonprofits.

Announcing the Integrated Cloud Initiative for Nonprofits

In 2017, Blackbaud and Microsoft announced an expanded partnership to digitally transform the nonprofit space, which features a three-point commitment: deeper integration between Microsoft and Blackbaud solutions; joint sector leadership initiatives that make innovation, research and best practices more accessible to nonprofits around the world; and a commitment to pursuing best-in-class nonprofit cloud solutions that bring together the best of both companies’ innovation. Blackbaud and Microsoft have driven significant progress toward their shared goals over the past year and said they intend to go even bigger with the announcement of the Integrated Cloud Initiative for Nonprofits.

“The Integrated Cloud Initiative for Nonprofits will accelerate nonprofit digital transformation to empower them to make an even bigger impact in the world,” said Justin Spelhaug, general manager, Microsoft Tech for Social Impact. “Over the past 12 months, Microsoft and Blackbaud have prioritized building product integrations in high-impact areas defined by nonprofits and partnered with NetHope as founding partners of The Center for the Digital Nonprofit. We’ve listened to the nonprofit community and are committed to building integrated solutions that work together and help these change-making organizations unleash the power of data in ways the market has not yet seen.”

The Integrated Cloud Initiative for Nonprofits will deliver interoperable, performance-enhancing solutions that address needs across the mission lifecycle—from raising resources to delivering programs, managing operations and measuring outcomes. The two companies will combine the power of Blackbaud’s industry-leading nonprofit solutions with innovative, jointly-developed and delivered cloud capabilities built on Microsoft Dynamics 365 that leverage the Common Data Model for Nonprofits and Blackbaud’s Intelligence for Good™— all backed by Microsoft Azure.

Introducing Nonprofit Resource Management, Jointly Developed by Blackbaud and Microsoft

According to the Global Humanitarian Overview 2018, more than 134 million people across the world need humanitarian assistance and protection—with just 97 million targeted to receive aid. At the same time, financial requirements to deliver is over $25.3 billion, with only $10.5 billion of that funded. The report adds that ”humanitarian agencies are committed to becoming more effective, efficient and cost-effective in order to respond faster to crises and in ways more attuned to the needs of those they are trying to help.” Yet today, nonprofits focused on humanitarian aid and assistance must operate without purpose-built technology to manage the complexities of distributing resources to the front lines at the right time.

Blackbaud and Microsoft’s first jointly developed solution suite, Nonprofit Resource Management (NRM), addresses this need. From managing the distribution of material goods to financial and human capital distribution, NRM will help nonprofits ensure accurate and efficient distribution of resources and integrates across core business processes.

“We’re in an unprecedented era of humanitarian need, and it’s becoming more costly and complex to respond due to global conflicts, natural disasters, and localized challenges,” said Jay Odell, president and general manager, Blackbaud Nonprofit Solutions. “For nonprofits, particularly in the relief and aid space, the ability to effectively source, track, distribute and measure the impact of physical goods is a critical part of delivering their mission. Whether it’s urgently needed medical supplies, disaster response equipment, or essential needs like food and clothing, every dollar saved, and every supply more efficiently distributed has the power to transform and save lives. We’re proud to partner with Microsoft to introduce Nonprofit Resource Management in response to this need.”

NRM, which will be sold through both companies’ partner and sales channels, works seamlessly with Blackbaud’s flagship fundraising and other Blackbaud nonprofit solutions, providing a connected experience across the mission lifecycle. This integrated innovation offers an unprecedented solution to help nonprofits address the $14 billion funding gap for humanitarian aid, and to improve effectiveness for the over 97 million targeted to receive aid because it creates connected, intelligence-powered system to raise funds and gifts-in-kind, effectively manage and distribute resources, measure effectiveness, and improve over time.

The NRM solution suite is presently in development in collaboration with early adopters. The first capability set, Goods Distribution, will be released summer 2019, with program design and others to follow.

“NetHope, with its 57 nonprofit member organizations and The Center for the Digital Nonprofit, is committed to helping its members—in partnership with tech companies—do good better,” said Lauren Woodman, chief executive officer of NetHope. “The Nonprofit Resource Management suite and the Common Data Model for Nonprofits are two exciting initiatives that are addressing how organizations digitally transform to deliver far greater impact. This offers promise for the global nonprofit sector and more importantly, the world.”

Nonprofit Resource Management Outcomes

Until now, nonprofits have not had a true resource management solution designed specifically for their unique needs, nor one that provides visibility into the unique patterns and practices of resource distribution. They rely on cumbersome spreadsheets, homegrown solutions, or antiquated tools to track inventory management on gifts-in-kind and goods distribution—resulting in lost time, wasted resources, vulnerability to fraud, and underutilized human and physical capital. NRM provides the industry’s first solution designed to address these critical needs, enabling nonprofits to:

“The Integrated Cloud Initiative for Nonprofits extends our joint commitment to help nonprofit organizations achieve loftier outcomes and improve the communities and issues they serve,” said Kevin McDearis, chief products officer at Blackbaud. “Nonprofit Resource Management will transform the way the sector captures and distributes resources to address the ever-increasing need and add value to the social economy. Combining Blackbaud’s industry expertise and pace of innovation with Microsoft Dynamics 365 and the Common Data Model for Nonprofits will allow us to jointly and rapidly deliver solutions that propel nonprofits forward in a very significant way.”

2018-10-04T14:43:59+00:00,2018-10-04T13:00:35+00:00,Press Releases,"REDMOND, Wash. — Oct. 4, 2018 — On Thursday, Redline Communications (TSX:RDL) and Microsoft Corp. announced a new partnership that will help address the rural broadband gap using TV White Space technology. Redline, a leader in private wireless networks, will provide its Virtual Fiber™ radio technology in the TV White Space band to Microsoft Airband Initiative partners. Together, Redline and Microsoft’s partnership will help make broadband internet more affordable and accessible to unserved and underserved customers in rural areas in the United States and globally.

New cloud services and other technologies make broadband connectivity a necessity to start and grow a small business and to take advantage of advances in agriculture, telemedicine and education. It is a vital part of 21st century infrastructure. Yet, more than 19.4 million Americans living in rural areas lack access to broadband and miss out on the opportunities that connectivity provides. According to a study from Boston Consulting Group, a connectivity model that uses a combination of technologies, including TV White Space, can reduce the cost of extending broadband coverage in rural communities. TV White Space is an important part of the solution, creating broadband connections in UHF bands and enabling communication in challenging rural terrains and highly vegetated areas, all while protecting broadcasters and other licensees from harmful interference.

This partnership is part of Microsoft’s Airband Initiative, which aims to close the broadband gap by extending access to 2 million unserved people in rural America by 2022, using a mix of technology solutions, including TV White Space.

“Our work with Redline will increase the availability of competitively priced TV White Space technology, enabling internet service providers (ISPs) to provide access to customers at an affordable price point,” said Paul Garnett, senior director of the Microsoft Airband Initiative. “This availability and utilization of TV White Space is absolutely critical to closing the broadband gap. This partnership will bring rapid evolution to the technology, making a real impact on real lives.”

“With its Virtual Fiber™ technology, Redline has been leading the TV White Space market and has been active in digital divide projects for almost a decade,” said Rob Williams, CEO at Redline. “In discussions with Microsoft, we realized that we shared the same vision for approaching the rural broadband gap, and we each possessed critical components to the solution. This partnership with Microsoft will help us address the digital divide more effectively in the U.S. and around the world.”

In addition to the partnerships with companies like Redline, Microsoft’s Airband Initiative invests in partnerships with ISPs and other telecommunications companies, introduces innovative solutions for rural connectivity, and provides digital skills training for people in newly connected communities.

Shantanu Narayen, CEO, Adobe (left), Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft (center), and Bill McDermott, CEO of SAP (right), introduced the Open Data Initiative at the Microsoft Ignite conference.

ORLANDO, Fla. — Sept. 24, 2018 — On Monday, the CEOs of Adobe (Nasdaq: ADBE), Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) and SAP (NYSE: SAP) introduced the Open Data Initiative at the Microsoft Ignite conference. Together, the three longstanding partners are reimagining customer experience management (CXM) by empowering companies to derive more value from their data and deliver world-class customer experiences in real-time.

In today’s world, data is a company’s most valuable asset. However, many businesses struggle to attain a complete view of their customer interactions and operations, because they are unable to connect information trapped in internal silos. At the same time, important customer information also resides in external silos with intermediary services and third-party providers, limiting a company’s ability to create the right connections, garner intelligence and ultimately extract more value from its own data in real time to better serve customers.

Companies around the world use software and services from Adobe, Microsoft and SAP to run product development, operations, finances, marketing, sales, human resources and more. Today, Adobe, Microsoft and SAP are joining forces to empower their mutual customers with the Open Data Initiative, which is a common approach and set of resources for customers based on three guiding principles:

Based on these principles, the core focus of the Open Data Initiative is to eliminate data silos and enable a single view of the customer, helping companies to better govern their data and support privacy and security initiatives. With the ability to better connect data across an organization, companies can more easily use AI and advanced analytics for real-time insights, “hydrate” business applications with critical data to make them more effective and deliver a new category of AI-powered services for customers.

“Adobe, Microsoft and SAP are partnering to reimagine the customer experience management category,” said Shantanu Narayen, CEO, Adobe. “Together we will give enterprises the ability to harness and action massive volumes of customer data to deliver personalized, real-time customer experiences at scale.”

“Together with Adobe and SAP we are taking a first, critical step to helping companies achieve a level of customer and business understanding that has never before been possible,” said Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft. “Organizations everywhere have a massive opportunity to build AI-powered digital feedback loops for predictive power, automated workflows and, ultimately, improved business outcomes.”

“Microsoft, Adobe and SAP understand the customer experience is no longer a sales management conversation,” said Bill McDermott, CEO of SAP. “CEOs are breaking down the silos of the status quo so they can get all people inside their companies focused on serving people outside their companies. With the Open Data Initiative, we will help businesses run with a true single view of the customer.”

To deliver on the Open Data Initiative, the three partners are enhancing interoperability and data exchange between their applications and platforms — Adobe Experience Cloud and Adobe Experience Platform, Microsoft Dynamics 365, SAP C/4HANA and S/4HANA — through a common data model. The data model will provide for the use of a common data lake service on Microsoft Azure. This unified data store will allow customers their choice of development tools and applications to build and deploy services.

With the Open Data Initiative, companies will be able to:

Technology leaders at top retail and consumer products companies, such as The Coca-Cola Company, Unilever and Walmart, have expressed support and excitement about the Open Data Initiative.

“This initiative from Adobe, Microsoft and SAP is an important and strategic development for the Coca-Cola System,” said Barry Simpson, chief information officer at the Coca-Cola Company. “Our digital growth plans centered around our customers are fueled by these platforms and open standards. A more unified approach to the management and control of our data strengthens our ability to support our growth agenda and our ability to satisfy security, privacy and GDPR-compliance requirements. The industry needs to follow these leaders.”

“Every day, 2.5 billion people use a Unilever product in over 190 countries around the world,” said Jane Moran, CIO, Unilever. “The Open Data Initiative from Adobe, Microsoft and SAP is an important undertaking that will help us reimagine customer experience management by bringing together data across our entire organization to build more direct, meaningful relationships with consumers in real time.”

“We’re excited about the Open Data Initiative and the value it will unlock for Walmart,” said Clay Johnson, executive vice president and enterprise chief information officer, Walmart Inc. “With greater ability to connect and harness the power of our data, we can enhance the associate experience and create entirely new ways to serve our customers online and in our stores.”

,2018-09-24T13:01:27+00:00,Press Releases,"ORLANDO, Fla. — Sept. 24, 2018 — Monday at Ignite 2018, Microsoft Corp.’s annual IT event, the company underscored the need for increased IT security and released an array of security programs and products. Among them are Microsoft Secure Score, a dynamic report card that assesses Microsoft 365 customer environments and makes recommendations that can reduce breaches up to thirtyfold, and Microsoft Authenticator, which helps make secure sign-on easier for workers with features like password-free login. The company also advanced its commitment to democratize access to AI through a new AI for Humanitarian Action program aimed at harnessing the power of AI for disaster recovery, helping children, protecting refugees and displaced people, and promoting respect for human rights.

“In this era of the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge, businesses in every industry are looking for a trusted partner to help them transform,” said Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft. “We are pushing the bounds in AI, edge computing and IoT, while providing end-to-end security to empower every organization to build its own digital capability and thrive in this new era.”

Cybersecurity is the central challenge of the digital age

Every day organizations take precious time and resources away from their core business mission to defend against, and recover from, cyberattacks. They operate dozens of complex, disconnected tools, yet the gaps between those tools remain and threats get through. As the nature of the threats and the profile of the attackers continue to evolve, security teams struggle to keep up, and skilled expertise is scarce.

Microsoft is uniquely positioned to help, and today the company shared ways it is empowering IT to unlock the security capabilities of the intelligent cloud. To tip the scales in the cyberwar, Microsoft has a unique focus on three things: security operations at global scale that work not just for us but also for our customers, enterprise-class technology, and broad cybersecurity partnerships for a heterogeneous world.

Security operations at a global scale that work for our customers: At Microsoft, more than 3,500 full-time security professionals work with leading AI tools to analyze more than 6.5 trillion global signals each day. The company’s global security infrastructure protects customers by securing datacenters, running a Cyber Defense Operations Center, hacking its own defenses (red-teaming), hunting down attackers, and blocking more than 5 billion distinct malware threats each month. Just recently, Microsoft’s cloud-based machine learning models detected — with only 200 discrete targets — a stealthy and highly targeted attack aimed at small businesses across the United States. The company neutralized the threat, called Ursnif, in seconds. Also, Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit, focused on advanced disruption and deterrence, has worked with global law enforcement agencies to take down 18 criminal bot-nets and rescue nearly 500 million devices from secret bot-net control.

Enterprise-class security technology: Microsoft is using the cloud to secure organizations broadly with new security features in its products that protect against a wide range of threats, secure the network and protect sensitive information:

Cybersecurity partnerships in a heterogeneous world: It takes more than the right technology and operations to make the world as secure as possible. It takes work to strengthen the broad ecosystem, bring the entire tech sector together, and partner directly with governments and democratic institutions. In close partnership with others, Microsoft recently made significant advances in this work.

Microsoft is working with tech companies, policymakers and institutions critical to the democratic process on strategies to protect our midterm elections. The company’s Defending Democracy program aims to protect political campaigns from hacking, increase security of the electoral process, defend against disinformation and bring greater transparency to political advertising online. Part of this program is the AccountGuard initiative, which provides state-of-the-art cybersecurity protection at no extra cost to all candidates and campaign offices at the federal, state and local level, and other organizations critical to the democratic process. In the first month, Microsoft has onboarded more than 30 organizations into AccountGuard, focusing initially on large national party operations, and the initiative now includes committees representing both major U.S. parties, as well as high-profile campaigns and think tanks. Microsoft is developing plans to extend the Defending Democracy program to democracies around the world.

Since the establishment of the Cybersecurity Tech Accord, an agreement to bring the entire technology sector together in defending all customers everywhere from malicious attacks by cybercriminal enterprises and nation-states, the group has nearly doubled in size. With 27 new organizations joining from around the globe since its launch, including Panasonic, Swisscom and Rockwell Automation, to name a few, the total number of signatories is now 61 companies, strengthening the broad ecosystem needed to keep the world secure.

In partnership with security teams across the company, the DCU has also combatted nation-state hackers. Using innovative legal approaches 12 times in two years, the DCU has shut down 84 fake websites often used in phishing attacks that were set up by a group known as Strontium, which is widely associated with the Russian government.

Around the world, the company is advocating for effective public policy by governments including stronger international rules, accountability through attribution, and the adoption of concepts like the Digital Geneva Convention.

Data and AI transform the intelligent enterprise

Furthering the company’s commitment to democratizing access to AI and ensuring that the benefits are widely shared, the company today launched AI for Humanitarian Action, a new $40-million, five-year program aimed at harnessing the power of AI to aid efforts such as disaster recovery, protecting children, refugees, and displaced people, and promoting respect for human rights. The company will do this by working deeply with select nongovernmental and humanitarian organizations through grants, investment of technology and shared expertise. This is the third program in Microsoft’s AI for Good initiative, launched in July 2017.

Microsoft is also continuing to deliver AI-infused products and services that will be available to billions of people through the next generation of applications, experiences and personal assistants. Today, Microsoft is announcing new products and services to help enterprises get the most value from their data:

Microsoft also unveiled new AI experiences in Microsoft 365 that make it easier for people to find information, create content, analyze data and collaborate with others:

Capturing value from IoT and edge computing

Computing is becoming more ubiquitous and simultaneously more distributed across the edge — connected devices, endpoints and geographies. With the power of AI, these devices can predict, learn, speak and more. This is all driving the next wave of innovation at the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge. Microsoft is delivering powerful IoT and edge solutions that unlock new opportunities for customers to bring cloud intelligence to new scenarios and to areas where connectivity is unreliable:

,2018-09-13T13:00:07+00:00,Press Releases,"REDMOND, Wash. — Sept. 13, 2018 — On Thursday, Network Business Systems Inc., an Illinois-based wireless internet provider, and Microsoft Corp. announced a new agreement to deliver broadband internet access to rural communities in Illinois, Iowa and South Dakota, including approximately 126,700 people who are currently unserved.

This partnership addresses a critical need, as approximately 36 percent of people living in rural Illinois, 22 percent in rural Iowa and 25 percent in rural South Dakota lack access to broadband internet. In today’s digital economy, broadband internet access is a necessity, enabling people and small businesses to take advantage of advancements in technology, including education, healthcare and precision agriculture, and access a range of cloud-based services to run their businesses and improve their lives.

The partnership with Network Business Systems is part of the Microsoft Airband Initiative, which aims to extend broadband access to 2 million unserved people in rural America by July 4, 2022. Network Business Systems will construct and deploy wireless internet access networks using a mix of technologies including TV white spaces — vacant spectrum that can travel over long distances and rough terrain, including the heavy foliage that is common in the Midwestern landscape.

“Everyone deserves to have access to broadband — no matter where they live — because access to broadband is access to digital opportunity,” said Shelley McKinley, Microsoft’s head of Technology and Corporate Responsibility. “Our partnership with Network Business Systems will help ensure that hundreds of thousands of people in Illinois, Iowa and South Dakota can participate in the 21st century economy.”

“Bringing broadband internet to underserved areas is more important than ever, especially as industries including education, healthcare and business are depending more on internet access,” said Kari Hofmann, general manager of Network Business Systems. “We are very glad that Microsoft is investing the money in championing the further use of TV white spaces.”

Across the U.S., 19.4 million people in rural areas lack access to broadband internet. The Microsoft Airband Initiative is focused on bringing broadband coverage to people living in rural America through commercial partnerships and investment in digital skills training for people in the newly connected communities. Proceeds from Airband connectivity projects will be reinvested into the program to expand broadband to more rural areas.

Being a technology consulting company, NBS identified a long-term need for rural internet providers that would be able to grow with the demand that rural America has, while handling the financial challenges that go along with providing rural broadband. NBS continues to provide high speed internet networks by partnering with local governments and agricultural companies. By partnering with local companies, we are able to keep costs down and provide robust internet connections and the lowest price possible to the consumer, while paying a living wage to our employees. NBS is a rural broadband provider to the residential, small business, and to enterprise sized businesses that need carrier grade connections with SLA agreements that are just as reliable as a fiber connection in urban cities.
